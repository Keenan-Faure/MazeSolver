This project takes the following into consideration:

- math algorithms
- searching algorithms like BFS and DFS
- unit tests
- resursive functions
- importing python modules
- tkinter to display
- Object Orientated Programming (OOP)

Code execution process (what and when it executes) has been commented out.

**Adjusting values of maze and cells**:

- You may increase or decrease the width, height of the `win` Window element, but keep in mind that in decreasing the size of the window the amount of cells to display would drop as well

- You may adjust the size of the cells when initializing the `Maze` class. Keep in mind point above

**How to run**:

- Navigate to the directory of the file then:

```
python3 maze.py
```
